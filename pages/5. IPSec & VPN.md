# Notes
- **VPN**
	- ways to create VPN
		- via private addressing (unsecure)
		- Via protected routing (IP tunnel) (unsecure)
		- Via cryptographic protection of the network packets (secureIP tunnel) (secure)
			- aka S-VPN
- **IPSEC**
-
- **IPSec security association**
	- the security properties of the secure IPSec channel created between the sender and the receiver are stored in a structure called **Security Association (SA)**
	- the SA is unidirectional, it contains all the (security) data necessary for IPsec processing of outgoing and incoming packets
	- an IPSec device stores all active SAs it currently has in a database, called SAD (logically divided into outgoing and incoming)
	- each SA may have (associated) different security services
	- two SA are needed to get complete protection of a bidirectional packet flow
	- **Security Association Database (SAD)**
		- contains list of active Sas and their characteristics ( algorithms, keys, parameters) logically divided into outgoing and incoming connection
	- **Security Policy Database (SPD)**
		- a-priori configured (e.g. manually) or connected to an automatic system (e.g. ISPS, Internet Security Policy System)
		- it contains a list of **security rules** to apply to the different packet flows, set
		  by the user. Each rule contains:
			- **Selector:** can be IP addresses, IP address range, TCP/UDP ports etc
			- **Action:** Discard, Bypass, Apply IPsec(pointer to the SAD containing specific SA)
		- rules are scanned by their order and packet is processed according to the first match. so it is possible to apply IPsec only in certain destinations
- **IPSec operation modes**
	- **Transport mode (End-to-end)**
		- IPSec encapsulation is done by the source (sender) of the original IP packet, and the de-encapsulation is done by the destination (receiver) of the IP packet
	- **Tunnel model (GW-to-GW)**
		- IPSec encapsulation and de-encapsulation is done by gateways along the route between the source (sender) and destination (receiver)
- **IPSec Protocols**
	- **AH**
		- versions
			- 1st version
			- 2nd version
		- format
		- authentication
		- encapsulation
		- decapsulation
	- **ESP**
		- versions
			- 1st version
			- 2nd version
		- in transport mode
		- in tunnel mode
		-
- **IPSec v3**
	- in the last version of IPSec AH is optional, ESP is mandatory
	-
- **IPSec architectures**
- **IPSec key management**
