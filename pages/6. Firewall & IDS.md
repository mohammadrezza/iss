# Notes
- **HTTP Proxy**
	- **forward proxy**
	- **reverse proxy**
- **Firewall types**
	- **packet filter (network level):**
		- it is a very simple one but the fastest, which can only check the IP header, so source and destination addresses, and some data from the transport or datalink level
	- **circuit gateway (TCP level):**
		- this fragment can investigate the payload and inspect the segments, but only that
	- **application gateway (application level):**
		- it is the most accurate one, because it controls also the application data, and take decision. It is also more secure but it needs more time to do this operations
- **Intrusion detection system**
	- **active IDS**
	- **passive IDS**
