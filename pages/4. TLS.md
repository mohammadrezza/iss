# Notes
- **TLS definition**
	- it is a protocol for creating a secure communication channel over the Internet
	- that replaces SSL, which is the original old version of the protocol
	- it is built on top of TCP running at transport level
	- SSL/TLS protocol versions below TLS v1.2 are insecure and deprecated
- **TLS security properties**
	- **Peer authentication of the server**
		- this allows to verify that the client is connecting to the legitimate server, defending
		  against an attacker impersonating the server
	- **Message confidentially (data confidentiality)**
		- ensures that attackers cannot read the traffic exchanged
	- **Message authentication and integrity**
		- ensures attackers cannot modify the traffic exchanged or inject new data
	- **Provides protection against replay, reordering, filtering/cancellation attacks**
	- **Easily applicable to all protocol on TCP**
		- HTTP, SMTP, NNTP, FTP, TELNET
- **TLS operation phases**
	- **TCP connection (3-way handshake)**
	- **TLS handshake**
	- **Data transfer**
	- **TLS teardown**
- **TLS session vs TLS connection**
	- **TLS session**
		- is a logical association between client and server
		- created by the TLS handshake protocol
		- defines a set of cryptographic parameters common for several connections
	- **TLS connection**
		- a transient channel between client and server
		- associated to one specific TLS session (1:1)
		- crypto parameters negotiated for each TLS connection
		- multiple TLS connections may share the same TLS session for efficiency
- **TLS Architecture**
-
- **Forward secrecy**
- **TLS activation**
	- **TLS then proto**
	- **Proto then TLS**
