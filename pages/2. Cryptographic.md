# Notes
- **Terminology:**
	- a message in clear text will be referred to as **P**
	- an encrypted message will be referred to as **C**
- **Symmetric**
	- aka secret key cryptography
	- Kerchoffsâ€™ principle
		- If the keys are kept secret, managed by trusted systems, and are of adequate length, then the encryption and decryption algorithms do not need to be kept secret. In fact, it is better to make them public for analysis and identification of potential weaknesses.
	- **algorithms**
		- **block algorithms**
			- divide the data in blocks of fixed length, each block is processed one at a time
			- **DES**
			- **3DES**
			- **AES(RIJNDAEL)**
		- **stream algorithms**
			- operate on flows of data, one bit or one byte at a time
		-
- **Asymmetric**
	- aka public key cryptography
	- **algorithms**
		- DH
